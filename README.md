### **Project Overview**
The **AI Vision Assistant** is a web application designed to bring AI-powered vision capabilities to life. By integrating a camera interface with real-time image processing and AI query handling, users can interact with the app to analyze their surroundings, recognize objects, and receive context-aware responses.

### **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend:** Next.js (React-based framework for server-side rendering and modern UI development)
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express.js for REST APIs)
- **Database:** MongoDB (NoSQL database for scalable storage of user data and logs)
- **Cloud Infrastructure:** AWS (S3 for image storage, Lambda for real-time processing, and CloudWatch for monitoring)

### **Features**
#### **Core Features**
1. **Wakeup Command:** Activate the system using voice commands like "Arise."
2. **Real-Time Image Capture:** Stream and capture images from the device's camera.
3. **Object Recognition:** Analyze the environment to identify objects using AI models.
4. **Text Recognition (OCR):** Extract text from images for queries like document reading or signage understanding.
5. **Contextual Query Handling:** Ask AI questions about the recognized objects or text.

#### **Authentication**
1. **Login and Signup:** Secure user authentication with password encryption and token-based session management.
2. **Custom Wakeup Commands:** Allow users to personalize voice activation commands.
